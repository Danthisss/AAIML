Automated Blood Smear Image Classification
This project is an AI-powered image classification system that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze blood smear images and classify them into categories such as healthy or infected. It aims to assist in medical diagnostics by automating the identification of abnormal blood cells with high accuracy.
Ideal for use in labs or as a supportive tool for doctors, this project showcases the application of machine learning in the healthcare domain.
